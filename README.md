Gameplay tips:

To open doors, right click near the base of the sprite.

Use hit and run tactics in combat. Coming in at enemies from multiple angle and retreating is more effective than just wading in.

Enemies can be knocked back when struck, preventing them from hurting you. A good barbarian can slay many foes this way.

Legend has it that a potion seller may be found within the depths of this dungeon. Find her, talk to her, and she may prove to be of help in your quest.
